Amazon EC2 Instance Setup

Last Updated: 05/06/2025

This is a guide for setting up an Ubuntu Instance using Amazon EC2. This guide document is designed to be used alongside the Minecraft Server setup guide found [Here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/setting-up-a-minecraft-java-server-on-amazon-ec2/#aws-page-content-main)

Follow the instructions on the AWS Blog, and use this guide as a reference as to deploying an ubuntu instance for the same purpose.

At step 4, select 'Ubuntu' and use the default AMI.

At step 5, since the options for instance type are different from the ones listed in the blog, choose one based on your own server needs, including RAM requirements depending on the type of server and number of players. 

Skip steps 12 to 16. The instructions for this portion of setup are covered in [The Minecraft Instruction File](/MinecraftInstructions.md)
